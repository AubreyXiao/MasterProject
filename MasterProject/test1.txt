If I had not read Pat Barker's 'Union Street' before seeing this film, I would have liked it/n Unfortuntately this is not the case/n It is actually my kind of film, it is well made, and in no way do I want to say otherwise, but as an adaptation, it fails from every angle/n<br /><br />The harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern England working-class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after I had finished/n I was put through tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy and misery when reading about the women of Union Street/n Excellent/n A novel that at times I felt I could not read any more of, but I novel I simply couldn't put down/n Depressing yes, but utterly gripping/n<br /><br />The film/n Oh dear/n Hollywood took Barker's truth and reality, and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it/n A beautiful film, an inspiring soundtrack, excellent performances, a tale of hope and romance/n/n/nyes/n An adaptation of 'Union Street'/n/n/nno/n<br /><br />The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed into Fonda's character, their stories are touched on, but many are discarded/n I accept that some of Barker's tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing, and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn't practical, but the content is not my main issue/n The essence and the real gut of the novel is lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine, pretty houses, and a twinkling William's score/n<br /><br />If you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of 'reality', I advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like 'Schindler's List'/n/n/nbut without the happy ending/n
